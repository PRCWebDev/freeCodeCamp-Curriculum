          <p>
            "Gheorghe Hagi is a Romanian football manager and former
            professional player, who played as an attacking midfielder. He is
            currently the owner and manager of Romanian club Farul Constan»õa.
            Hagi was considered one of the best players in the world during the
            1980s and '90s, and is regarded by many as the greatest Romanian
            footballer of all time. He was known as "Regele" ("The King") to
            Romanian supporters. Nicknamed "The Maradona of the Carpathians", he
            was a creative advanced playmaker renowned for his dribbling,
            technique, vision, passing and shooting."
